# **SolarSave: Harnessing the Power of the Sun for Sustainable Energy Savings**

## **Project Overview**

In an age where energy consumption is growing exponentially, **SolarSave** takes a pioneering step towards the future by providing a blockchain-powered, IoT-based platform that focuses on optimizing and incentivizing **solar energy usage**. SolarSave brings together cutting-edge technologies like **blockchain**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to track solar energy production, optimize energy efficiency, and promote sustainability through a rewards system. 

Our vision is to create a decentralized network where each solar energy producer contributes to a greener world and is rewarded in **SolarCoin (SQC)** for energy-saving behavior. SolarSave is designed for individuals, communities, and institutions who want to reduce their energy costs, minimize their carbon footprint, and participate in the renewable energy revolution.

### **Why SolarSave?**

With the growing threat of climate change and global energy challenges, optimizing energy usage and harnessing renewable energy sources is critical. SolarSave aims to make solar energy generation more efficient, traceable, and incentivized through data-driven approaches. 

1. **Data-Driven Optimization**: SolarSave uses real-time data collected by IoT devices to monitor solar panel performance and energy consumption, providing actionable insights for users to reduce waste and maximize efficiency.

2. **Blockchain-Powered Incentives**: By integrating **blockchain technology**, SolarSave ensures transparency, security, and a reward mechanism based on actual energy data. Users earn **SolarCoin (SQC)** for contributing solar energy data and optimizing energy usage.

3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: SolarSave is scalable and flexible. Whether you're a small home user or a large institution, SolarSave offers the tools you need to optimize energy generation and track environmental impact.

## **Project Details**

### **Key Features**

- **IoT Device Simulation**: 
   SolarSave simulates IoT devices (solar panels) that track solar irradiance, temperature, and energy output. The device generates real-world-like data that is analyzed and processed by the platform.
   
- **Blockchain Integration**:
   SolarSave connects the energy producer (the IoT device) to a decentralized blockchain network. Energy data is submitted to the blockchain, and in return, the producer earns **SolarCoin (SQC)** tokens as a reward for optimizing energy usage.

- **Real-Time Monitoring & Insights**: 
   SolarSave provides users with real-time data on their energy generation and consumption, allowing them to make informed decisions about energy optimization, storage, and consumption.

- **Predictive Analytics & AI Optimization**:
   Using machine learning algorithms, SolarSave predicts solar panel efficiency and suggests ways to improve energy usage. The system can recommend actions like panel cleaning or energy storage optimization based on weather conditions.

- **Rewards System**:
   SolarCoin (SQC) tokens are used to incentivize energy-saving behavior. Users earn SQC for each unit of energy saved and can withdraw rewards to a connected wallet on the blockchain.

### **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: The backend is developed using Python to simulate solar energy devices, process energy data, authenticate devices, and connect with the blockchain.
  
- **Solidity (Ethereum Blockchain)**: The smart contract is written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, handling device registration, energy data submission, and SQC rewards distribution.

- **Next.js/React**: The frontend is built with Next.js and React, providing an interactive dashboard for users to monitor their solar energy performance, submit data, and view rewards.

- **Web3.js**: Web3.js is used for communication between the frontend and the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to interact with smart contracts through MetaMask or other Ethereum-compatible wallets.

- **Docker**: The project is containerized using Docker to ensure a consistent development and deployment environment.
