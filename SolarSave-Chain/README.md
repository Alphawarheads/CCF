**Key Improvements:**

- **ERC20 Integration:** Integrated with an ERC20 token for SolarCoin (SQC) using OpenZeppelin's `IERC20` and `SafeERC20` libraries, enabling secure token transfers.
  
- **Access Control:** Utilized OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract to manage administrative functions, such as adjusting the reward rate and deactivating devices.
  
- **Security Enhancements:**
  - **Reentrancy Protection:** Applied `nonReentrant` modifier from `ReentrancyGuard` to the `withdrawRewards` function to prevent reentrancy attacks.
  - **Input Validation:** Added require statements to validate inputs and ensure that functions are called under correct conditions.
  
- **Device Management:** Introduced an `isActive` flag within the `Device` struct to allow for device deactivation by the contract owner.
  
- **Event Logging:** Added comprehensive events for all critical actions to facilitate transparent tracking and easier debugging.
  
- **Encapsulation:** Made the `devices` mapping private to restrict direct access and provided getter functions for external access.
  
- **Modularity:** Separated concerns by adding specific functions to retrieve the calling device's reward balance and total energy produced.

**Usage Notes:**

- **Deployment:** The contract requires the address of the deployed SolarCoin ERC20 token during deployment. Ensure that the token contract is deployed first.
  
- **Device Registration:** Devices register themselves by calling `registerDevice` and providing a unique device ID.
  
- **Energy Submission:** Registered and active devices can submit their energy production data using `submitEnergy`, which calculates and accumulates rewards based on the current reward rate.
  
- **Rewards Withdrawal:** Devices can withdraw their accumulated rewards by calling `withdrawRewards`, which transfers SQC tokens to their address.
  
- **Administration:** The contract owner can adjust the reward rate, deactivate devices, and update the SolarCoin token address as needed.

**Security Considerations:**

- **Access Control:** Only the contract owner can perform administrative actions, protecting critical functions from unauthorized access.
  
- **Reentrancy:** The `nonReentrant` modifier safeguards the `withdrawRewards` function from reentrancy attacks.
  
- **Safe Token Operations:** Using `SafeERC20` ensures that token transfers are executed safely, handling any non-standard ERC20 implementations.

**Dependencies:**

Ensure that you have the following OpenZeppelin contracts installed:

- `@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol`
- `@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol`
- `@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol`
- `@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol`

These can be installed via npm:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```
