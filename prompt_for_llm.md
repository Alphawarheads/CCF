Hereâ€™s the broader view of the **SolarSave project** code and sub-tasks divided based on different tech stacks:

### **Overview of the Project**
- **SolarSave** combines Python, Solidity, and Next.js (React) to simulate solar energy devices, interact with a blockchain for rewards, and provide a user interface for monitoring and submitting energy data.
- **Core Components**:
   1. **Python Backend**: Simulate IoT devices (solar panels), process data, authenticate devices, and interact with the blockchain for data submission and rewards.
   2. **Solidity Smart Contract**: Manage device registration, energy submission, and rewards in SolarCoin.
   3. **Next.js/React Frontend**: A web interface for monitoring solar energy performance and interacting with the blockchain.

### **Broad View of the Code**

#### **1. Python Backend**
   - **IoT Device Simulation**: Simulate solar panel data such as irradiance, temperature, and energy output.
   - **Blockchain Interaction**: Submit energy data to the blockchain smart contract and manage rewards.
   - **Data Processing**: Clean and process the raw data, and calculate daily summaries.
   - **Device Authentication**: Use blockchain for secure device authentication.
   - **AI for Optimization**: Use basic ML models to predict and optimize energy usage based on historical data.

#### **2. Solidity Smart Contract**
   - **Device Registration**: Register new devices on the blockchain.
   - **Energy Data Submission**: Store energy production data.
   - **SolarCoin Rewards**: Reward devices with SolarCoin for optimized energy usage.

#### **3. Next.js/React Frontend**
   - **Device Dashboard**: Show device details like energy produced and rewards.
   - **Energy Submission Form**: Allow devices to submit energy data and view rewards.
   - **Blockchain Interaction**: Use MetaMask or similar wallets for user interaction with the smart contract.

### **Sub-task Assignment by Tech Stack**

#### **Python Backend**:
1. **IoT Device Simulation** (`device_simulation.py`):
   - Simulate solar panel data (irradiance, temperature, energy output).
   - Implement real-time data generation using basic first principles.
   - Add randomness for data variability.

2. **Blockchain Interaction** (`blockchain.py`):
   - Connect to Ethereum blockchain using Web3.
   - Implement functions to register devices, submit energy data, and retrieve rewards.

3. **Data Processing** (`data_processing.py`):
   - Clean and process the data generated by the devices.
   - Implement daily summaries and filtering for anomalies.

4. **Device Authentication** (`auth.py`):
   - Secure authentication using private/public key cryptography.
   - Generate and manage private keys for devices.

5. **AI/Optimization** (`analytics.py`):
   - Use simple linear regression to predict energy output based on historical data.
   - Provide optimization recommendations based on current solar conditions.

#### **Solidity (Smart Contract)**:
1. **Contract Setup** (`SolarSave.sol`):
   - Write a Solidity smart contract to handle device registration.
   - Implement energy data submission logic.
   - Add SolarCoin reward distribution based on energy output.
   - Deploy on Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli).

#### **Next.js/React Frontend**:
1. **Blockchain Interaction** (`contract.js`):
   - Integrate Web3.js for connecting the frontend to the smart contract.
   - Handle user wallet connections (e.g., MetaMask).
   
2. **Device Dashboard** (`index.js`):
   - Display device information such as energy produced, SolarCoin rewards, etc.
   
3. **Energy Submission Form** (`submit-energy.js`):
   - Create a form for submitting energy data.
   - Display submission status and rewards.

4. **UX/UI** (`components`):
   - Create an interactive and user-friendly interface for monitoring devices and submitting energy data.

### **Next Steps**
You can distribute these sub-tasks to different team members according to their expertise. Have Python developers focus on the backend, Solidity developers on the smart contract, and JavaScript developers on the frontend.
